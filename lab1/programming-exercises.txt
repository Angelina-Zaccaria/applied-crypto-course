1). The following ciphertext was generated by AES 128 in CBC mode, using the given key and IV
values. Write a program to find the plaintext. Make sure that the ciphertext is all on one line, to avoid
adding an extra newline character in the middle. The key and IV are both 16 bytes long, which is
necessary for AES.

Ciphertext (Base64):
hTpVHO39rnpFyThzbcI+gg0rdBcbHL+5OqWFFY8QDF6T/nX4+O1lXFgJnDbRFaC1lL5hFY3uVsbQ8mP14yeSDNnD2d
FnhBZLbkjqriE8IwJfcA3yL1Q3LhKQVUWPgPrZVvL98RtKl9ZEYCW/Sb7egw==

Key:
Have you failed?

IV:
This is your IV!

2). Given a partial secret key (first 13 bytes) and IV, try breaking AES encryption in CBC mode
by searching for the last 3 bytes of the key. Find the associated plaintext.

Partial key (the first 13 bytes, in hex format):
{0x01,0x23,0x45,0x67,0x89,0x1a,0xbc,0xde,0xf0,0x01,0x23,0x45,0x67}

IV (in hex format):
{0x10,0x20,0x30,0x40,0x50,0x60,0x70,0x80,0x90,0xa0,0xb0,0xc0,0xd0,0xe0,0xf0,0x00}

Known beginning text: "The unknown message is:"

Ciphertext (Base64):
A8K+2+60yXYmEBQHOW4BN/2f/ubS5JMHy/B4hpGiaHDbR4qGLBL0AiwvUKi/th+lHt2meNQ82Zmfmnk2+r

3). This exercise is to create a primitive password-checking program. The two ciphertexts below were
both created using DES in CBC mode. Write a program that stores each ciphertext (either in a file or in
the program memory, since we’re only dealing with two) and accepts a username and password as
input. You should perform DES encryption in CBC mode on the given username with the password as
the key and compare it to your known ciphertexts. A match should produce a success message, and a
failure should produce an error message. Note that if the username is less than 16 characters, you
should pad it with spaces.

Ciphertext 1 (Base64):
o9k5Gm1iUvNQJ5wtLPl+dIMk/bmxe9RY9O94tw==

Username: "User#1          " (16 characters, padded with spaces)
Key: "MyPassword#1"

Ciphertext 2 (Base64):
H5t2slzx1alYS91tOGesOubScL3R1UIq9B93tw==
Username: "User#2          " (16 characters, padded with spaces)
Key: "A_newPW"

Both use IV = “My iv”
